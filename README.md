# Data-Extraction-from-Job-Search-Websites
This project extracts data from 3 job search websites using BeautifulSoup and generates word clouds.

# Description
This code was created because of a uni project. The goal was to find out what is currently being required from former production engineers. In that sense, 3 main job search websites were chosen to be scraped: Indeed, Linkedin and Catho. Using BeautifulSoup, job titles, companies names, companies cities and a job summaries of over a 1,000 job opportunities were collected. After that, word clouds were created so the most common words in these fields could be easily visualized.
